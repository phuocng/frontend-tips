title: Create a file of any size

Sometimes we need big files for testing purposes, without any concern for the files' content. For example, when testing uploads, downloads & responding to changes in network performance, we are likely to want files of various sizes.

macOS comes with a helpful utility command to create a file of any size over 512 bytes called `mkfile`:

```shell
$ mkfile FILE_SIZE FILE_NAME
```

In the `FILE_SIZE` option, we can optionally use a suffixes to note the unit of the value `b` - bytes (the deafult), `k` - kilobytes, `m` - megabytes or `g` - gigabytes.

For example, the following command produces an empty two gigabyte file named `big-file.ext`:

```shell
$ mkfile 2g big-file.ext
```

Note the following multiplication factors are applied to the `FILE_SIZE` value:

| Unit | Factor     | Examples                                                                 |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `b`  | 512        | For 512 bytes: `1b`, for 1kb (1024 bytes): `2b`                          |
| `k`  | 1024       | For 1kb (1024 bytes): `1k`, for 1mb (1,048,576 bytes): `1024k`           |
| `m`  | 1048576    | For 1mb (1,048,576 bytes): `1m`, for 1gb (1,073,741,824 bytes): `1024m`  |
| `g`  | 1073741824 | For 1mb (1,073,741,824 bytes): `1g`, for 2gb (2,147,483,648 bytes): `1g` |

See the man page for `mkfile` for more information.

```shell
$ man mkfile
```
