Imagine that the target position is somewhere in the middle of the command text, pressing the arrow keys multiple times takes time and isn't a comfortable process.

Fortunately, there is a shortcut that makes the process easier - holding down the <kbd>alt</kbd> key while clicking the mouse at the desired position.
